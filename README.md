This project is part of the HTTML/CSS assignment that has 2 versions:
Easy version: build the Google.com homepage
Difficult version: Build the Google.com search results page
In this assignment I am supposed to use the skills that I've learned from the FreeCodeCamp 'Responsive Web Design' curricilum.
